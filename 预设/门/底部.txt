grammar:
  - you should replace `${description}` with output described in description
  - you should follow additional requirements in `$(requirement)` but never ever output it
  - you may output additional content according to former rules and content when encountering `...`
  - you MUST remove `\` for `\${description}`, `\$(requirement)` and `\...` but output the remain part directly without any modification; e.g. `\${some text}` -> `${some text}`, `\$(some text)` -> `$(some text)` and `\...` -> `...`
  - you should output others directly without any modification
